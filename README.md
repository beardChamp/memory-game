# memory-game
It's a memory game! I wanted to build a memory game as a personal challenge.

## Constraints
Right. My MacBook Pro died a while ago, so all I've got at home is an older PC for the kids' school work. It CAN run node, but it's not fast by any means. Also, my kids are really loud. It's hard to focus at the school machine, so I did the vast majority of this at the library on a terribly locked down public machine.

That said, I went with jQuery instead of something like Angular and React. I could work with fairly static files to build a decent experience in limited environments.
